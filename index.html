			<h1>World Population</h1>
			<p><h5>This visualization narrative provides view of world population by countries and quality of life by countries. The world population is the total number of humans currently living, and was estimated to have reached 7.7 billion people as of April 2019 It took over 200,000 years of human history for the world's population to reach 1 billion and only 200 years more to reach 7 billion.<br>
			It also provide visualization of World Population growth from 1960 to 2017, based on several factors it also provides view which country provides best quality of life. </h5></p>
			<h3>Scene 1 </h3>
			<p>This scene describes the map of world population in 2017. I have used geo-map to visulaize this scene, when we place mouseover on the map it will show the rank of the country and its population in 2017. </p>
			<p>China is the most populous country in the world with a population exceeding 1.4 billion. It is one of just two countries with a population of more than 1 billion, with India being the second. As of 2017, India has a population of over 1.355 billion people, and its population growth is expected to continue through at least 2050. By the year 2030, the country of India is expected to become the most populous country in the world. </p>
			<p>The next 11 countries that are the most populous in the world each have populations exceeding 100 million. These include the United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Russia, Mexico, Japan, Ethiopia, and the Philippines. Of these nations, all are expected to continue to grow except Russia and Japan, which will see their populations drop by 2030 before falling again significantly by 2050 </p>
			<h3>Scene 2 </h3>
			<p>When it comes to choosing the best country to live in, the answer you come up with might differ from the answers of other people, especially because it all depends on what you are using to define a country as being the best. Whether itâ€™s happiness levels, overall financial stability, type of climate, or something completely unrelated to any of these suggestions, the definition of the number one country to live in is entirely subjective., however this visualization allows us to see different countries and their relative ranking on following parameters</p>
			<ul type="disc">
			<li>Quality of Life</li></li>Purchasing Power</li><li>Safety</li></li>Health Care</li><li>Cost of Living</li><li>Property Price to Income Ratio</li><li>Traffic Commute Time</li><li>Pollution</li><li>Climate</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Scene 3 </h3>
			<p>This visualization allows us to view the growth of World Population from 1960 to 2017, gowth was very rapid - the global population is more than doubled. This data is taken from United Nations Population Division.In this visulation we have tip at the bottom which will show us the year and respective year population.</p>
